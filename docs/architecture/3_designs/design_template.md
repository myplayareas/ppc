# 3. Designs

## 3.1. Design Template [Name of the functionality]

* **Date**: [date when you made the design]
* **Participants**: [who participated in the elaboration]
* **Ticket**: [if you have a ticketing system e.g. JIRA]

### Requirements or Problem

Explain here the requirements of the new functionality, or simply link to a different resource if it's already documented somewhere.

Make sure the requirements are functional and focus on the problem you want to solve, without mentioning the solution.

### Constraints

Include here a numbered list of your constraints. Think about:
 
* _Timing_ for organizational processes, acquiring licenses or dependencies 
with other teams.
* _Knowledge_ of the teams.
* _Physical or Virtual Resources_. For example infrastructure.
* _Money_. Don't limit your search to technical features but also check 
licenses.
* _Security/Availability/etc._

### Decisions and Meetings

Add here references to other sessions, in case you have them, where you discussed this topic and/or made decisions impacting this design.

As you can see, this is just a way to keep more structured pages like this one (Designs) separated from other more unstructured pages like decisions and meeting notes (possibly including quick notes and pictures).

You may also write down directly in this section if those notes are short enough. You could even omit this section entirely if the design doesn't need the whole process.

### Solution Design

Include here the solution description. My recommendation is that you use drawings like Sequence Diagrams and Block Diagrams.
