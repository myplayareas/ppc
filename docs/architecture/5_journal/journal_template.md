## [Template] YYYY-MM-DD [Meeting title]

* **Date**: [date of the meeting]
* **Participants**: [names, or name of the community/chapter]

Sections below are just an example. This may be an unstructured document so feel free to use your own style. You can prepare this record in advance. This way, people can read the goal and agenda and send you extra questions or topics if they have.

### Goal of the meeting

In one sentence: what do you want to achieve with that meeting?

### Agenda

List of bullet points describing what you want to cover during the meeting.

### Meeting Notes

Include decisions made during the meeting, or design approaches, etc. It's always useful to capture images of the whiteboard in design sessions and add them here later.

### Action Points

Are there any actions for specific people? Add them here so it works as a reminder but also as commitment.
