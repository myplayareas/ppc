## 1.4. Architecture Overview

The most important part of this section should be the System Context and the Container diagrams (C1 and C2 respectively in the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/)). 

I recommend you to follow a *Diagrams as Code* approach and use a tool like [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/) to keep them in the repository. With PlantUML you can generate quickly very simple diagrams, but you can also use some available extensions like [C4-PlantUML](https://github.com/RicardoNiepel/C4-PlantUML) to make them look much nicer. Besides, you can use [Plantum-icon-font-sprites](https://github.com/tupadr3/plantuml-icon-font-sprites) to decorate some components.

They should tell most of the story by themselves, but feel free to add some description if you need more details.

If you're starting a project from scratch, avoid including here your *Target Architecture*. This section should reflect the current status of your Architecture, not the ideal situation where you want to be (that will be placed in the *Roadmap* section).
