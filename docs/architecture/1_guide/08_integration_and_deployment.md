## 1.8. Integration and Deployment

Explain here how you build your software and which tools you use. If you have Integration Tests, describe how they work and how you run them. In case the whole process is orchestrated by pipelines, write down how they work or include links to the documentation.

This section should also cover your Deployment process: is it a continuous deployment or triggered by coordinated releases? Is it a manual process or fully automated?
