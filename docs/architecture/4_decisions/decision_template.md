## 4.2. [Template] Decision: [title]

* **Date**: [date when you made the decision]
* **Participants**: [who participated in the decision]
* **StakeHolders**: [people impacted by the decision, interested in it]
* **Status**: [can be either Complete, Draft or Work in Progress]

### Background

Explain here your current status in relation with the topic. If you found a 
problem, describe what is its impact. If there are new requirements, explain 
what you want to achieve. 

If you have an external system with stories or issues, you can also provide 
here a link to avoid duplicating the information.

### Alternatives

Now you can describe the solution. Try to look for alternative approaches. 
Also, if you need an external provider, do a research and describe what are 
the different providers available.

### Constraints

Include here a numbered list of your constraints. Think about:
 
* _Timing_ for organizational processes, acquiring licenses or dependencies 
with other teams.
* _Knowledge_ of the teams.
* _Physical or Virtual Resources_. For example infrastructure.
* _Money_. Don't limit your search to technical features but also check 
licenses.
* _Security/Availability/etc._

### Decision

State your preference and your decision. Note that they **don't need to 
match**. Explain why you made that decision, you can reference constraints 
by number.

### Action Points

It's also very useful if you include in this section the Action Points, with 
names of people that will work on making this decision happen.
