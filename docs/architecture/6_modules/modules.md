# 6. Modules (or Teams)

You can use this section to organize Architecture and Software docs per module or per team, as you prefer. 

The reason to not include these docs in the main structure is that you may have, for example, designs and decisions that are local to a particular team or module so they are not that relevant to the rest.

Useful content examples here are Component and Code diagrams (see [C4 model](https://c4model.com/)) and Sequence Flow diagrams, that help a lot to understand how your system works in detail.
