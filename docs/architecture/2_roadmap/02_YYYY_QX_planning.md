## 2.2. YYYY-QX - Architecture Roadmap

It would be too bad if time is spent only in making diagrams, designs and writing specifications. You need to get it done. 

A practical way to get it done is by meeting with stakeholders and project managers and make sure that the Architecture Roadmap is included in the planning. 

Create one of these files per month or quarter, and keep an eye on task progress.

This is an example of how you can prepare a simple Planning Table in Markdown:

| Task                         | Sprint 1      | Sprint 2 | Sprint N |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Extract Email module         | Team A        | Team A   |          |
| Reuse upload file component  |               | Team B   |          |
